# nflfastr-dashboard
This is a dashboard displaying advanced NFL team metrics using nflfastr play by play data. Using these advanced team stats, regression & classification ml models are trained on this data and provide 2025 week 1 game and score predictions on the spread. For over/under, I use a k neighbors classifier to find similar games played between 2010-2024.
